**Project**: hr-connectify 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/83bef394-6eed-4291-8296-fea1625a7414/improve

**Description**: Let's create an HRMS application for TSVGlobal.

Let's create a sign-forgot password/reset password screen via supabase auth.

The admin will create new users via the superbase UI.
Once the user is created, an email should be sent to the user's email id. Users can then log in using that credentials

The user will log in to the application URL provided by the organization.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
